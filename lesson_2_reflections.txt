What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When a repository is initialised using the "git init" command the .git
    directory is created in the current working directory

    Existing files are not automatically committed to the repository

    The .git directory will contain all the repository meta-data

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains files which have been marked for commit by the
    "git add" command

    These files are contained within the working directory.

    When the "git commit" command is run they will be added to repository
    contained in the ".git" directory

    The staging area provides a way of separating temporary files created during
    the development process from the more permanent project files
