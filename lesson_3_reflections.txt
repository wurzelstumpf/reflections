When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    To use as a backup for your work
    
    In order to share your work with other people
    
    In order to collaborate with other people
    
    When working from multiple devices

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Some of the changes made may have been extensive and conflict with
    your own line of work.  Hence it might make sense to review what
    has changed since you last ran a "git pull" from the remote before
    running a "git push"

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

    Forks occur on GitHub and are generally used to obtain a copy of a
    repository that you would like to modify but don't have access to
    as a Collaborator

    A clone is simply a copy of a repository either from a remote
    source such as GitHub or a local directory

    Branches identify different commit histories within a single
    repository and are useful for experimenting with changes to the
    code base
